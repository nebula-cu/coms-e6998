I am a second year PhD student at Columbia University, working with [Prof. Kostis Kaffes](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kkaffes/). I am interested in distributed systems, cloud computing, and performance optimization. 
<!-- Currently, I am currently working on Virtual Machine Scheduling for oversubscribed cloud datacenters. I am a member of [Nebula Lab](https://nebula-cu.github.io/), and previously was at [Microsoft Research NRG](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/networking-research/people/). -->
