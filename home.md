## Overview

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;">
One of the most significant transformations in the computer sector over the last decade has been the rise of cloud computing. 
Companies are progressively transferring their tasks to external cloud platforms and utilizing advanced global services that were previously unattainable within individual data centers.
Nonetheless, the construction and utilization of cloud systems entails tackling numerous intricate research challenges.
This research seminar will explore both industrial and academic contributions to cloud computing, focusing on systems for machine learning and machine learning for systems.
Participants will analyze and guide discussions on research papers, and collaborate in small groups to undertake a research project throughout the semester.
